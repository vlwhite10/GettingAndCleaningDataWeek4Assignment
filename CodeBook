1. Merges the training and test data to create one data set

  Read in the dataset and assign column names.
  features: 'features.txt' -> list of all features
  TestSubjects: 'subject_test.txt' -> test subject data
  TrainSubjects: 'subject_train.txt' -> training subject data
  
  Compile Train dataset
  GalaxyTrain: 'train/X_train.txt' -> training data set
  GalaxyTrainLabels: 'train/y_train.txt' -> training data set labels
  GalaxyTrain: Merged data sets GalaxyTest and GalaxyTestLabels
  
  Compile Test set
  GalaxyTest: 'test/X_test.txt' -> test data set
  GalaxyTestLabels: 'test/y_test.txt' -> test data set labels
  GalaxyTest: Merged dataset of GalaxyTest and GalaxyTestLabels
  
  Combine Test and Train datasets
  GalaxyData: rbind dataset GalaxyTrain and GalaxyTest
 
2. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   Activities: 'activity_labels.txt' -> Activity_Name and Activity_ID cross reference
   GalaxyData: Merge Activies and GalaxyData

3. Extracts only the mean and standard deviation variables for each measurement.

   GalaxyData: Subset dataset by selecting columns that contain 'mean' and 'std'

4. Creates descriptive variable names

   Renamed the column names in GalaxyData so they are more standardized and descriptive

5. From the data set in step 4, a second, independent tidy data set is created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

   GalaxySummary: Second data calculating the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject in GalaxyData
